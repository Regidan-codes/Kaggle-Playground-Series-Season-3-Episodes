# Playground-Series-Season-3-Episode-3

The dataset has been taken from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/playground-series-s3e3/data)

The dataset for this competition (both train and test) was generated from a deep learning model trained on a Employee Attrition. Feature distributions are close to, but not exactly the same, as the original. Feel free to use the original dataset as part of this competition, both to explore differences as well as to see whether incorporating the original in training improves model performance.

Files

    train.csv - the training dataset; Attrition is the binary target
    test.csv - the test dataset; your objective is to predict the probability of positive Attrition
    sample_submission.csv - a sample submission file in the correct format
